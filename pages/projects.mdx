# Projects

Highlighting some projects I've worked on (and hope to coninue working on) recently.

### News-GPT
I've been wanting to dive into the hype around Chat GPT a bit and it turned out to be a fun project. This was a fun project. I learned some new things about APIs and got to play with technologies I don't use every day. 

News-GPT does a few things:
1. Queries a public NewsAPI and returns the top results (right now searching for "data analytics")
2. Sends the top articles to OpenAI where GPT-3.5 writes a breif summary of the key points
3. Writes the summary to a markdown file and uploads to GitHub 
4. Bonus: Vercel auto deploys the updated website with the new posts

Next steps:
- Fix the search query so that more than just forbes articles show up
- Automate the script (maybe a Vercel chron job, maybe Airflow, Lambda function, so many options)
- Find a better way to display the articles (maybe more of a stream with a DB)
- Allow signup to newsletter

### This Website
I used Vercel to get this portfolio site up and running in an afternoon. While I wouldn't call myself a web developer Vercel works similar to Astronomer and Platform9 in that it provides an easy way to run scalable and reliable websites while providing some great tools for developer productivity (local dev, git integration, etc.).

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.

Next steps:
- Customize the css, make it feel modern
- Add a serverless function
