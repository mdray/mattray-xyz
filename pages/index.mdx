## Work Experience

### Astronomer
Our data orchestration platform allowed centralized teams to run reliable and scalable Airflow while making developers more productive. I worked with Global 100 customers to solve challenges with running data teams at scale. 

### Turbonomic
Turbonomic's technology helped customers assure application perfomance while minimizing cost in cloud and Kubernetes environments. I worked with customers to understand and design solutions to their scaling challenges. 

As the organization grew from 150 to 700 people, I helped to build and recruit enterprise presales teams in the Central and Western US. I developed POV methodoligies that were utilized company wide to improve conversion rates, and rolled out training to over 50 team members. Turbonomic was acquired by IBM. 

### IBM Cloud
In the IBM Cloud unit we focused on enabling the back office transition to cloud in large enterprises. I worked to design and launch offerings consumed by marketing teams, and helped to develop usage frameworks to make it more attractive for IBM customers to consume cloud. 

### Platform 9 Systems
Platform9 allows users to deploy and run Kubernetes clusters anywhere and manage them locally. As one of 4 presales engineers I helped to drive engagments with customers primairly focused on distributed and edge use cases. We proved that a retail customer could spin up and manage a 3 node K8s cluster in every store, while managing infrastructure and updates centrally.
