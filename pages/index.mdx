## Work Experience

### Astronomer
I worked with Global 100 customers to solve challenges with running data teams at scale. Our data orchestration platform allowed centralized teams to run reliable and scalable Airflow while making developers more productive.

### Turbonomic
I helped to build Presales teams and process to grow the business from 150 to over 700 people. As a player I worked with customers to solve challenges in scalling applications, particularly on Kubernetes and Cloud, in a performant matter without breaking the bank.
